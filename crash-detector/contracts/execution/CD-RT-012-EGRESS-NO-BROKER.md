# Execution contract — CD-RT-012-EGRESS-NO-BROKER

**CD-AC-012** · No execution pathway exists · obligation **MANDATORY** · scope **CLASS** ·
delivered in **WO-2**

This document exists because `REQUIRED-TEST-REGISTER-CONTRACT-v1` check 3 requires every
declared test to name an execution contract that RESOLVES. It states how this test is run
and what its exit codes mean. **It states no result.** The register carries obligations;
status is computed by the validator from the register, the PID and append-only run records,
and there is no field anywhere in this chain in which an author could write a verdict.

## The proposition

cd-engine, cd-public, cd-private and cd-store have no egress at all, and no egress allowlist anywhere names a broker.

## Command

```
python3 tools/register/check_egress_no_broker.py --root .
```

Run with the working directory set to **the root of a subject tree the auditor extracted
itself** — `git archive <sha> | tar -x -C <tmpdir>`, never the Engineer's worktree. The line
above is verbatim: no path fixing, no editing, no wrapper. There is no run-everything
harness in this repository and there may not be one, because an auditor verifying through a
harness the project wrote is verifying the harness (`PBG-ASSURE-001`).

## Subject

`deploy/compose.yaml` — the two networks, the per-service egress posture and every allowlist entry.

## Why it is asserted this way

Source and dependencies are only two of the three ways an order could leave. The third is the network, and a service that can reach the internet can reach a broker whatever its code says.

## Preconditions

* `python3` 3.11 or later. **Stdlib only** — no install step, no network, no
  virtualenv. A check that needs a package installed is a check the auditor cannot run.
* The subject tree extracted by the auditor, with the working directory set to its root.
  `--root .` is not a default and is not optional: it is there so that the check is always
  pointed at a tree explicitly, and never at whatever directory it happens to sit in.

## Exit semantics

| exit | meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | CLEAN — assertions were made and all of them held. A run that made ZERO assertions refuses instead, so `0` can never mean "I looked at nothing". |
| `1` | VIOLATION — at least one finding, each printed with its file, its line and why it is one. |
| `2` | USAGE — the command line was wrong. |
| `3` | PRECONDITION NOT MET — the check could not do its job, with the reason on stderr. |

Anything other than `0` is a failure. **The check never skips, for any reason**
(`PBG-CI-002`): a precondition it cannot meet is a non-zero exit with a stated reason,
never a pass.

## Negative control

A broker host added to any container's egress allowlist, or any egress at all granted to cd-engine, cd-public, cd-private or cd-store — the four services BLUEPRINT §13 requires to have none. Both halves are the same proposition: a service that can reach the internet can reach a broker, and an allowlist that names one has already conceded the point.

Detection is a **contrast**, and the validator computes it as one: the same declared command
must exit `0` on the clean subject and non-zero on the subject with the violation planted.
A clean arm that fails cannot be told apart from a broken harness, and a broken harness
detects nothing — the validator returns `UNDECIDABLE`, never `PASS`.

The negative control for this test is declared as run record **`RTR-WO2-0001`**.
That record does not exist yet. It is the run the **independent Assurance
seat** will produce — a distinct actor from the one that wrote this test. Until it exists
the validator computes `UNDECIDABLE` for this test and the gate stays shut, which is
correct: this seat may declare which run must evidence its guard, and may not supply it.

## What this contract does not claim

It does not claim the test passes. It does not claim the criterion is satisfied. It does not
admit any evidence: `latest_admitted_run` is null in the register and this seat cannot fill
it in, because an implementation may not certify itself (`PBG-SOD-001`, non-waivable).
